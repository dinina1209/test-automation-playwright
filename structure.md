# Workshop Structure

In this document, we will outline the structure of the workshop to provide a clear roadmap for the students. The workshop will be divided into the following sections:

## Introduction

Let's check some of the main questions you might have about the ðŸ¤–Test Automation Essentials workshop!

## Third-party accounts

Easy peasy, just create a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com) if you don't have one already. You will also need an account on Discord, which you can create [here](https://discord.com).

## Lectures

There is one formal live lecture that will be delivered twice on Tuesdays at 12.30 pm and 7 pm. They will be recorded for people who can't attend live or want to review the content later.

Depending on the demand, I will add more live lectures so we have more opportunities to interact and discuss the content.

I will also produce pre-recorded lectures as required.

Both the pre-recorded and the recorded live lectures will be hosted on my youtube channel, [Free Range Testers](https://www.youtube.com/@FreeRangeTesters).

## This is a dynamic course

I have so much to share with you, and I want to make sure that you get the most out of this course. I will be adapting the content based on your feedback and questions, as well as how we make progress. Feel free to ask me anything!

## Assessments

As the Practical AI for Developers course, Test Automation Essentials is being delivered under Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) model. This gives you a lot of flexibility in how you approach the course, but also means that you need to be proactive in managing your learning.

As part of our sessions, I will always give feedback based on my experience and expertise, so you can improve your skills. I will also provide you with a set of exercises and challenges that you can work on to practice and reinforce your learning.

## Live Support

I will be available for live support on Discord every Friday from 1.30 pm to 2.30 pm. This is a great opportunity to ask questions, clarify doubts, and discuss the content of the course.

We hope this structure provides a comprehensive and organized approach to the workshop, ensuring a valuable learning experience for all participants. If there is anything you would like to know more about or have any questions, feel free to reach out to us!
