## Optional üòâ

- [ ] How would you approach defining different URLs for different test environments? Lets say you have a test environment, a staging environment, and a production environment. How would you approach this problem?
- [ ] At the bottom of this [Automation Sandbox](https://thefreerangetester.github.io/sandbox-automation-testing/) I've created, you will find a table called "Tabla Din√°mica" (Dynamic Table in Spanish). This table has a particularity...it changes all the values every time the page reloads.
  - Your task is to automate the following scenarios:
    1. **Find the value of the cell in column 3, row 4**: Print the value of this cell. Make this method reusable for any combination of Row and Column.
    2. **Does it change for real??**: Test that all the values change every time the page reloads.
