# Week 1 Progress Reflection

## How was the pace of this first week?
The pace was good not bad at all.

## What are you looking forward to see next week?
First and foremost, I need to understand how Git works and gain confidence in using the right commands at the appropriate times. Additionally, I want to ensure I grasp the basics of TypeScript.

## What was something that you would have liked to see more of on this first week?
Learning the basics of coding and understanding the concepts why things are done in a particular way.

## What was something that you would have liked to see less of on this first week?
Nothing really.

I feel a bit overwhelmed as Iâ€™m falling behind on understanding the basic concepts. I would be much more confident if there were more interactive sessions to help me learn better.
