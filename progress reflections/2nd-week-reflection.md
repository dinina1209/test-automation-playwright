## What are you looking forward to see next week?

## What was something that you would have liked to see more of on this second week?
I would love to have some more exerises for Ui testing with Playwright.

## What was something that you would have liked to see less of on this first week?

## Is automation more or less intimidating than you thought it would be? Why?
I agree that it’s not intimidating, but it does require some practice and time to grasp the concepts and understand how the framework is designed to work. Learning and practicing are ongoing processes.
