# Lets practice what we learned about STLC and OOP.

## Instructions

Please answer the following questions about the application of STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the context of Automation Testing:

1. How can Automated testing, from what you know at this point, help on each STLC stage?
2. What do you disagree with the most about the STLC principles? Why?
3. Explain the importance of modularity and reusability in automation testing, and how OOP principles support these concepts.
4. How does a conditional statement in programming looks in two different languages such as Python and Java? What do you observe?
5. If you had to sell automated testing to a project right now...what would you say to convince them?

Please provide as much detail on each answer as you want, without any pressure. This is a great opportunity to reflect on the concepts you've learned and how they can be applied in practice. Feel free to share your thoughts and experiences on these topics.
