# Week 4 questions: Automation best practices and Playwright

**Intructions**
During Week 4 we will work on our own automation framework repository and learn about automation best practices and Playwright. This repository will serve as the foundation for your final project, so treat it as you would a real piece of work in a real project with fellow testers and developers looking at it...because that's what will happen! We will also learn about the Page Object Model, automation best practices, and Playwright.

With that in mind, let's start with some interview questions related to our week 4 topics.

## What is the Page Object Model?

## What are the benefits of using the Page Object Model?

## What are the best practices for writing automated tests?

## What is Playwright?

## What are the key features of Playwright?

## What are the differences between Playwright and Selenium WebDriver?

## What are the advantages of using Playwright over Selenium WebDriver?

## What are the disadvantages of using Playwright over Selenium WebDriver?

## What are the best practices for writing Playwright tests?

## Complete the following exercises:

We have this wonder of design...an e-commerce site to buy clothes! You can access it [here](https://react-shopping-cart-67954.firebaseapp.com). Currently, we are working on the shopping cart feature. Your task is to automate the following scenarios using Playwright:

1. **Filter**: Filter by size and validate the results are showing the criteria you selected.

2. **Adding Products**: Add a product to the cart and validate it is there.

3. **Removing a product**: Remove a product from the cart and validate it is not there.

4. **Total price**: Add more than one product to the cart and validate the total price is correct.

5. **Checkout**: Complete the purchase and validate the order was successful (at the moment you will see a modal with a message, no payment methods available yet for testing).

**Extra**: Any other tests you can think of at this stage of the development?

## Once happy with your tests, create a Pull Request in your repository and ask for a review from me. Make sure to include the test results in the PR description.

## Once the PR gets approved, merge it to your main branch.

Feel free to practice these actions in the heroku URL assigned to each task to enhance your test automation skills.
